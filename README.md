# raytracer-c

Current executables (and sample output) are:

## main/parabola

simple demonstration of tuple implementation, shooting a projectile with gravity & wind vectors...

## main/sphere_shadow

Matrix implementation allow us to cast rays...and intersect them with a sphere

## main/phong_render_sphere

Phone shading!

## main/phong_render_three_spheres

Multiple objects, but they are all spheres...Some are simply scaled to look flat.

## main/phong_render_three_spheres (with shadows)

Same executable but now shadows are added...

## main/phone_render_three_sphere_and_plane

Slightly newer executable but now with a plane instead of "squashed spheres"

## main/phong_render_three_spheres_and_striped_plane

Very similar but now the plane has stripes.

## main/reflection

Now the central sphere has a reflection...

## main/refraction

Added a sphere with some refraction.  Need to make a better demo image.

## main/refraction_cube

Added support for cubes, also allowing an object to opt out of shadow calculation.
